# Arrays

 - console.table(s) -> Prints any array with well thought out graphical representation.
 - s=[] -> Creates an empty array.
 - s.push(n) -> Pushes element n at the end of the array. Indexing starts from zero.
 - s.pop() -> Removes last element.
 - ss = [s1, s2] -> Creates a 2D array formed by the two rows s1 and s2.
 - ss[n] -> Returns the nth row of the 2D array.
 - ss.push(s3) -> Adds row s3 to the 2D array.
 - ss.pop() -> Removes last row.

 ### Notes on iteration.

 - for i in s -> iterates over the indexes
 - for i of s -> iterates over the values
